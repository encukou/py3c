py3c Changes
============


Version History
===============

v1.1 (2019-10-04)
-----------------

Compatibility:

* Tests updated to pass with Python 3.8.0rc1
* Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer tested (due to lack of CI support)


v1.0 (2018-02-06)
-----------------

Additions:

* Add Py_UNREACHABLE from Python 3.7
* Add Py_RETURN_RICHCOMPARE from Python 3.7
* Add Py_UNUSED from Python 3.4

Deprecations:

* The macro PY3C_RICHCMP is deprecated in favor of Py_RETURN_RICHCOMPARE.
  There are no plans to remove the old macro from py3c.

Fixes:
* The PyStr_Concat function no longer causes GCC warnings about being unused.

Tests:
* The test suite now fails on unexpected compiler warnings.

Packaging:
* py3c is now on PyPI, thanks to @xoviat


v0.9 (2017-11-08)
-----------------

Tests:

* Adapt tests to Python 3.7 regarding const correctness (thanks to Marcel Plch)

Build:

* Fix includedir substitution on OS X (thanks to Branko Čibej)
  (This might cause make to fail if includedir, by default /usr/local/include,
  is not present; in that case it needs to be created.)
